Auto compile JADE files on save

[Atom package site](https://atom.io/packages/jade-autocompile)

## Configuration
The two first comment blocks of file can be used to pass parameters to the compiler.

* The first one must have the name of the output html file, like this:

  ```jade
  //output:output.html
  ```
  If you avoid this comment, the file is omitted by the compiler.

  The output parameter supports relatives paths and two variables replacement.
  * $1: Name of the original jade file
  * $2: Extension of the original file.

  Also you can add other properties to the compiler, like this:
  ```jade
  //output:output.html, pretty:false
  ```

* The second block can have a javascript object to be used as locals for the compiler.

  ```jade
  //{
      name: 'Manuel',
      date: new Date,
      myFunc: function(){
        return true;
      }
    }
  ```
